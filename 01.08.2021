I. From "The Art of Linux Kernle Design"
========================================
1. All x86 CPU work in 16-bit real mode at start-up.
2. At start-up:
        CS: 0xFFFF
        IP: 0x0000
        Thus, CS:IP = 0xFFFF0
   So, when the power button is pressed, something in the motherboard sets CS and IP register like this, which initiates the start-up sequence.
3. The BIOS in question here only 8Kb in size, spanning 0xFE000-0xFFFF0 in address space.
4. After CPU got the BIOS, the interrupt vector table is built and interrupt service routine is executed. The user sees the motherboard maneufacturer's
   logo and related stuffs in the start screen at this time.
5. At startup, All x86 CPU uses only 1Mb memory in RAM, from 0x00000 to 0xFFFFF.
6. The interrupt vector table is put in the first 1Kb: 0x00000 to 0x003FF.
7. Some breakdown: 0x003FF is 0000 0000 0011 1111 1111 in binary. So 10 digis of 1 = 2^10 = 1024
