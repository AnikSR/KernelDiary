Note: This is documented in 31st July, 2021. So, a lot of things are forgotten.

1. Packages needed to install in the mother linux for configuring or install the new
kernel:
	- aptitude (libssl-dev was installed using aptitude)
	- libssl-dev
	- libncurses-dev (to run menuconfig)

2. menuconfig is amazing, to learn and to configure. Hope to have many adventures with
   it.

3. "make defconfig" makes the config file with all default configuration. How to compile
   all the specific non-default config option to a single file and make the .config with
   specific alteration using a single command like "defconfig" is to be investigated.

4. Documentation of the configured kernel was created using "make pdfdocs" as instructed
   in the README file of the downloaded kernel. But building the documentation requires
   "graphviz" and "dlophin" packages.

5. bzImage is located in the "arch/x86/boot" file. Its no longer "arch/i386".

6. grub is configured by editing the "/etc/default/grub" file. A good, simple overview
   on grub configuration is found in the info file of the grub, using the command:
   		
		info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'

7. Fun fact: 'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE' variable controls whether the boot menu will showup or
   not. 'GRUP_TIMEOUT' holds the value of how long the boot menu will wait for me.

8. However, main suggested (at Ask Ubuntu) edits are changing 'GRUB_DEFAULT' variable to
   "saved" (default value is 0) and GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true. GRUB_DEFAULT variable selects
   which kernel is the default kernle and GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT allows choosing the default
   kernel on boot manu - as far I understood. I haven't implemented these suggestion,
   since the new kernel has been automatically selected to be the default kernle upon
   installation (#make install). Other kernels are available in the advanced option at
   the boot menu.

9. The new kernel 5.13.6 takes quiet a while to load. While the OS is being loaded, an
   error message show up saying: Wrong EFI loading signature. The installation definitely
   left a lot of rough edges, smooting those will come in the following days.

11. The new kernel is unable to connect to the host computer, which is normal since I
	haven't installed guest addition to this kernel. The error tells that the system
	can't identify the filesystem "vboxsf". Guest addition was installed with:

		$sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-x11
	
	But mouting failed with the error:

		sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: No such device

	Unfortunately rebooting didn't fix the problem.

12. Older kernels 5.8.63 and 5.8.25 are going black after the login!

Todays tasks are done from the book "Linux Kernel in a nutshell". The book is old and a
lot of stuff do not match. But its still a pure gold.
